# iMX8M_mini_Ref_Hardware_AAR
  i.MX 8M Mini SOM with 2/4-GB-LPDDR4 Reference Hardware

An eight-layer reference design SOM based on i.MX8M mini that I have designed for educational purposes, note that I have deliberately created very small problems(in power planes and some nets and manufacturing problems) in this design to prevent its commercial use and production, but this is a very practical reference design, especially for training. Over time, other sections will be added to this series of projects.I will try to provide simulation files and other documentation for universities.
Please be diligent in maintaining and publishing it because a lot of time has been spent on its design.
Please publish the file only through my GitHub link.
